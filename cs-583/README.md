# CS 583 Analysis of Algorithms

Used java to implement the proposed data structure in this research paper - "Violation Heap: A relaxed Fibonacci-Like Heap" by Elmasry
This was to confirm the proposed time complexity affected by the size of the heap. 
Report contains the graphs charted between a counter VS n for the following data structure functions -
1. insert(x,h)
2. delete-min(h)
3. decrease-key(delta,x,h)
4. 3-way-join(z,z1,z2)
5. createForest()
6. rankAndKeyMap()
